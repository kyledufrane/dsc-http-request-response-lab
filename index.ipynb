This takes live raw data from NASA's systems and turn them into APIs related to space and spacecraft.

To access them, you would add the endpoint to the base url of the API.\n","\n","For the OpenNotify API, we have following end points \n","\n","1. Current Location of the International Space Station `/iss-now.json`\n","2. Overhead Pass Predictions for the International Space Station `/iss-pass.json`    \n","3. Number of People in Space `/astros.json`\n","\n","The `.json` extension simply tells us that the data is being returned in a JSON format.\n","\n","In this lab, we'll be querying this API to retrieve live data about the International Space Station (ISS).
